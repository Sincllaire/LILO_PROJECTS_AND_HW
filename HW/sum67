  objective: return the sum of the array 
  constraints: if the array has a 6 in it: it needs to return as a 0
  if there are numbers after the 6: they need to also equal 0
  they numbers will count as 0 until a 7 comes up, after the 7, 
  the numbers contain their real value 
  basically ignore the number 6 adn 7 and any numbers in the array if they are between the 6 and 7 

  logic:
  for n in nums:
  if n == 6 or n == 7:
  return 0
  for nums in range(6,7)
  return 0
  else:
  return n
